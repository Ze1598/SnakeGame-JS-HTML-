# SnakeGame-JS-HTML-

A very simple Snake game created using JavaScript and HTML. To create this game I followed this tutorial on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TcU2C1AACw&index=1&list=PLt4757glfbhHkfz7dqojMbnBdgUnFih4B&ab_channel=LearnWebDevelopment

Regarding the resources I used, their sources are linked in the resources/resources_source.txt file.
